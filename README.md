This code can be used to schedule messages to be sent on whatsapp.
For that, you need to be logged in to whatsapp web on google chrome.
The functionality of searching for a contact and sending message to them is not working properly, 
so for now, you can pin the required contact on top, an this code will send the message to that contact only.


Edit: The code has stopped working since the last whatsapp update, will update it later.
